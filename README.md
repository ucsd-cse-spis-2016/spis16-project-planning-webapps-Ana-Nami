# Brief Description
We are very uncertain about our project plans. Although we are still considering other ideas, the following explain some of our potential plans.

####Plan 1
Users will choose either travel or living. For living, users will rank their value for vaious aspects of living (e.g. crime, education, places to find food, weather, health, retail sales, entertainment, hospitals, earthquakes, et cetera). For traveling, they will not rate retail sales or education. They will instead select their mode of travel and the importance of various aspects of travel their mode of travel. They will select the option for either a single location or for multiple locations. For both living and travel, they may also choose (or not choose) certain regions of the United States where they may desire to live or travel to. For each user, the website will compute this information to rank various places that may suit individual. Each place will be linked to information about each of the mentioned aspects of living. If the user inputs a specific location, the website will provide the information about this specific place. For travel, the website can create a "roadmap" that plans out the food/travel/et cetera for the trip.

####Plan 2
The website will have a homepage linked to signing in, creating a username, or beginning the game without a username. If the user chooses to begin the game without a username, the website will open a webpage for the first level of the game. If the user opts to create a new username, a small window will pop-up to ask for a username and password. It will check that no other user has the same username that is entered, If the user chooses to login, a box will expand for the user to enter in a username and password. If the user logs in, the website will take the user to the first incomplete level. If the user has never completed a level, the website will take the user to the first level. Each level is a PyGame, with each level increasing in difficulty. When the user completes a level, the website will store the information tied to the specific user (level completed, score, et cetera). The website will display the user's score for the completed level. The website will also rank/diplay the top users at each level, based on the users' scores. A logged in user can also view their record of high scores (with their date/time) for each level.
