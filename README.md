# Brief Description
We are very uncertain about our project plans. Although we are still considering other ideas, the following explain one potential plan.

On our website, we will present the user with an image that has been modified (i.e. as we did in Lab05). Using non-coding language (but still in some specified format), the user will input what they think that the modification was. The website will evaluate this guess and identify whether it is correct. Once the user reaches the correct answer, the website will ask the user to identify a way to reverse the modification, entering this in a certain, specified format. The website will convert the input into Python and apply the answer to the image, returning the new image.
