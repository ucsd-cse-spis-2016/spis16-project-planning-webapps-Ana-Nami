# Brief Description
We are very uncertain about our project plans. Although we are still considering other ideas, the following explain some of our potential plans.

####Plan 1
On our website, we will present the user with an image that has been modified (i.e. as we did in Lab05). Using non-coding language (but still in some specified format), the user will input what they think that the modification was. The website will evaluate this guess and identify whether it is correct. Once the user reaches the correct answer, the website will ask the user to identify a way to reverse the modification, entering this in a certain, specified format. The website will convert the input into Python and apply the answer to the image, returning the new image.

####Plan 2
Users will choose either travel or living. For living, users will rank their value for vaious aspects of living (e.g. crime, education, places to find food, weather, health, retail sales, entertainment, hospitals, earthquakes, et cetera). For traveling, they will not rate retail sales or education. They will instead select their mode of travel and the importance of various aspects of travel their mode of travel. They will select the option for either a single location or for multiple locations. For both living and travel, they may also choose (or not choose) certain regions of the United States where they may desire to live or travel to. For each user, the website will compute this information to rank various places that may suit individual. Each place will be linked to information about each of the mentioned aspects of living. If the user inputs a specific location, the website will provide the information about this specific place. For travel, the website can create a "roadmap" that plans out the food/travel/et cetera for the trip.
