# Brief Description
Users will instead select their mode of travel, the importance of various aspects of travel their mode of travel, and activities/sightseeing that the user enjoys, as well as other aspects of traveling (e.g. crime, education, places to find food, weather, health, retail sales, entertainment, hospitals, earthquakes, airline, gas station, et cetera). For travel, they may also choose (or not choose) certain regions of the United States where they may desire to travel to. For each user, the website will compute this information to rank various places that may suit individual. Each place will be linked to information about each of the mentioned aspects of traveling. If the user inputs a specific location, the website will provide the information about this specific place. For travel, the website can create a "roadmap" that plans out the food/travel/et cetera for the trip.

#Stages
*Stage 1:* Download the Python data sets on tourist attractions, museums, outdoors, food, and weather from CORGIS and Google Maps. Look through this data.
*Stage 2:* Organize the data into smaller sections of useful data.
*Stage 3:* Create the skeleton of a website with a homepage and two other webpages for traveling.
*Stage 4:* Write the code for creating traveling plans. Begin with only entertainment/activities (tourist attractions, museums, and outdoors). Write an algorithm to evaluate the data. Write the code for receiving input from the user. Create an algorithm for using this input to compute the importance of each aspect of the input, and to compare this with the evaluated data for an optimal travel plan. Write the code for presenting this information to the user.
*Stage 5:* If there is time, add more data sets into the input options to give the user more options for visiting places.
*Stage 6:* If there is time, enhance the method of outputting the results. (Create a roadmap that is a list with expandable tabs; then, (if time) create the code to present a visual map with the preferences.)
*Stage 7:* If there is time, add a PyGame. A link will appear beneath the outputted results, and it will open a new tab/webpage.
 Each PyGame will change have background correlating with the travel plans. The website will display the user's score for the completed level. The website will also rank/diplay the top users at each level, based on the users' scores. When the game is completed, it will ask the user to input a name for the score rankings if the score is within the top 10.

######Stages
*Stage 1:* Download the Python data sets (on crime, education, food, weather, health, retail sales, entertainment, hostitals, and earthquakes) from CORGIS, and look through this data.
*Stage 2:* Organize the data into smaller sections of useful data.
*Stage 3:* Create the skeleton of a website with a homepage and two other webpages for traveling and for living.
*Stage 4:* Write the code for creating traveling plans. Begin with only two aspects of traveling by car(food and gas stations) and by plane (airlines). Write an algorithm to evaluate the data. Write the code for receiving input from the user. Create an algorithm for using this input to compute the importance of each aspect of the input, and to compare this with the evaluated data for an optimal travel plan. Write the code for presenting this information to the user.
